    <h2>Rationale:</h2>
    The reason I picked these four colour scheme is because I wanted pastel colours. I feel as if pastel colours are not that bright and not to dull for the eyes of the viewers of this website.
    Colour scheme number one was inspired by the web api idea of researching the mind and personalities of people seen on social media platforms and if these are their true personalities or is it this what
    they want us to see online. this colour scheme is shows more femininity and should help with the personality on social media research since it is a known fact that women are on social media and their phones more
    than men. I as a female always carry my phone with me for example. Colour scheme two was inspired by my first prototype idea that was focused on the relationships in the Studio Ghibli world and how those relationships can relate to relationships
    in the real world. The main colours in this colour scheme are different shades of blue which suit well with the Studio Ghibli theme and idea that I had. I also pivked these colours cause I wanted something different.
    Colour schene three, it is kind of similar to colour scheme one but there are different colours that are darker than the original colours. Colour scheme 5 was inspired by the thought of the charts and data visualization that will be created soon. 
    I wanted colours that were going to work well and blend together without conflicting with each other. That was the main purpose of this specifically that I was planning this colour scheme for the data visualization and graphs. The colour scheme for thee graphs have
    been incorporated but have been switched and used for a circle graph instead of a second bar graph. I wanted to add more information for the circle graph but also I added blue so it could pop out more and not blend with the colour scheme of the website.

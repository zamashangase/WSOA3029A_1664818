    <h1>Week1:Overview of Data Visualization and Reflection </h1>
    <article>
    <p>
This blog post will be focused on the reading on the Overview of Data Visualization and reflects on this 
reading. The reading will be focused on the relationship between the data visualization and aesthetics. 
The first following chapter focuses on the concept of data visualization. The term “data visualization” 
has been known in human history for centuries. Data visualization contributes to the discovery and 
inventions created by mankind throughout human history. The chapter also uses the invention of 
computers as an example of the change of the way visual representation of data. The data analyst is 
the highest and successful accuracy in terms of using the computer graphical data visualization. It is 
an important part of research in fields such as animation, computer vision, algothrims and human 
perception. But data visualization is mainly associated with the field, computer science. This chapter 
has so far discussed the technology of data visualization which has evolved from early sketches and 
drawings. Data visualization focuses on the understanding of the data instead of having other 
approaches that are considered as traditional data visualization. (Li, 2020)There are different 
advantages of traditional data visualization. Firstly, it has the ability to represent a lot of data as quickly 
as possible. Secondly, it enables viewers to identify patterns in the data for new insights. Thirdly, it 
can be used product quality control where they can identify problems through the data analysis. The 
next chapter focuses on the definition of the data visualization. There are various meanings and 
definitions to the data visualization. Many of these definitions focuses on the connection between the 
data and the computer technology so the data can transform into a visual sonic form. Data 
visualization, involve an exchange of information that includes the messenger, the receiver, and the 
message. The purpose of the data visualization is to help and find patterns inside graphs and the 
exploration of data. (Li, 2020). The next chapter focuses on the definition of data and information. The 
chapter goes into detail about the data and how raw it is. It is unprocessed information that has not 
been recognized and it has various meanings. These variety of meanings include the numbers, the 
names, symbols, characters, signs, and symbols. The other meanings are also the graphs which were 
discussed in class. The other meanings are files and reports that are used for business context. Data is 
a part of giving information to society. Data includes collecting information from humans through the 
internet and smartphones and of course surveys. There are two different types of data including 
secondary and primary data. The secondary data focuses on the collection of data through the use of 
file reports, research reports, file censuses and surveys meanwhile primary data focuses on data that 
has been collected from numbers of people and interviews or studies made by taxpayers. (Li, 2020). 
Data visualization refers to the charts, tables, graphs, diagrams, and scatter plots. It is the visual form 
of these charts and other collection forms of data that represent the traditional version of data 
visualization. (Li, 2020)

<h1>Week2: Blog Post About Website I often Use </h1>
	<article>
<p>
The website I have chosen for this blog post is the Instagram website because Instagram is one of the 
websites I often use.
The design of the homepage, since Instagram is a photo sharing app so the main thing in the middle 
of the homepage is the image that has been shared by people you are following. The top corner of the 
homepage has the name of Instagram. The top right corner has an icon for people to send direct 
messages to whoever they are following. It also shows the number of messages you have not read. 
Below the shared images on the homepage, it shows the amount likes that each image has. There are 
three icons below the images that have been shared. The first icon is the heart icon you press when 
you like an image. The second icon is the comment icon used to comment on photos that have been 
shared. The third icon is used to share the image to people you follow in direct messages or on your 
story. There is an icon at the bottom of the image at the right corner that is used to save the image in 
a saved personal gallery on Instagram. The user can even caption the image to make it more 
interesting. There is an icon with profile picture that is used to share stories or give your opinion on 
different matters. There are icons on the bottom of the home page that when you click it you are 
directed to the explore page, the page that shows you who and how many people have liked your 
photos. An icon for your profile that takes you to your profile. Finally, there is an icon used for posting 
your images that you want to share.
The UI of the homepage, Instagram has a design process that is used on the user interface has 
systematic and information-oriented visual design. Instagram has an icon for businesses to sell and for 
consumers to sell their products. Instagram uses this icon to find international consumers because it 
is a worldwide website that is very popular especially to the youth. It has a feature for business 
markets and business owners to promote their products by paying for ads everywhere for potential 
customers to see and view the business profiles. (Marcus, 1998)
The UX of the homepage, the UX research looking at last semester’s readings including the needs and 
wants of human beings. The UX in the homepage in terms of needs on the website has links that lead 
the user to their personal profile, another need is for example if the user needs to see what their 
favorite person is doing or has posted on the profile and story on Instagram. The users want can be 
the on the explore page link on the homepage for users to search the profile they want to see or 
explore pages that might interest the user. Instagram has an algothrims and tends to show the users 
what they want or search or google and that aesthetic and content will show on the explore page for 
example, Instagram will show the profiles on the users’ favorite artists, hobbies, musicians, food 
recipes and anime fan pages. (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2011). Instagram is an example of a software 
that researches the emotions and interests of humans. Also, Instagram has a way of recommending 
you to other pages that you might find interesting. (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2011). Different users 
have different emotions depending on the data research.
According to Kidd the use of signs such as words, images and sounds is used for the representation 
that can be used for websites in order for the user to be familiar with the setup of the website and 
where to go. The signs are used for a medium of communication. There is no connection between the 
words, sounds and the things look on the website homepage and how things can be described. The 
representation of websites according to Kidd has semiotics including the coming together of the 
signifier and the signified that gives the user the sign. From my understanding from FVPA in first year 
the semiotics od the signifier and signified are the representation of an image or object and what is 
the meaning of it. As well as the emotions and theme surrounding it. (Kidd, 2020).

    <h1>Week3: My Website</h1>
    <article>
        <p>
          My design for my website is based on pastel colours or blue. That’s what I have been thinking of in term of the style guide. The main three colours for my first idea should be light purple, light pink and a baby light blue. Or maybe as my second idea light green, dark blue and medium purple. My third idea is based on the colours, light purple, dark purple and a medium purple with two other colours such as light pink and peach. My final idea is five colours light pink, brown, the brown that’s trending this year for aesthetics. Medium purple colour and medium bright peach. These will all be shown in the style guide in the design section of the website. The wireframes have already been added in with three practice examples also found in the design section. In terms of representation and visual communication which is actually partially new. Visual communication comes with a visual message that communicates with the viewer. (Kidd, 2020) According to Kidd, visual communication is more powerful in displaying a message than literacy because of the use of images. The communication of an image is supposed to be connotative or denotative. The creator must be confident in their work as it appeals to their target audience and the target audience will understands the product. There is context in everything. You as a person can understand different contexts based of one image. Images can be used for advertising something or displaying a powerful message. An image can historical and display a moment in time where the picture was taken if the image has famous historical figures or flags. Another example of images that can used on the website are graphs that are used for the data visualization of the website. There are also symbols that can be used. Looking into the UI purposes and functions. My website will be having a homepage displaying the design section which will contain the style guide, wireframes, and rationale. There is also a page for the data visualization containing graphs. A one-line graph and one heated map. There also a section focusing on theory blog post for each week. UI designing process is supposed to attract the target audiences by making the sections easy to locate and navigate the audience to the selected sections on the website. The UX of the website is based of the target markets needs and wants and that is found on the use of web api. It is just a matter of which web api will I be choosing as a main topic to communicate to the audience. The first idea was the study of studio Ghibli movies and the relation it has to actual human and animal relationships. For example. Howls moving castle can be based on the need to love oneself before loving someone or the love found in someone despite their flaws. The target market can find their needs on the website in the data visualization and their wants in the design process. Reading purposes can be found in the theory section considering information on representation and visual communication and representation. 
          The final design is a bit of colour I used from different designs from my style guide in the design </section>(Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2011) (Marcus, 1998)

    <h1>Week4: Bonus Blogpost</h1>
    <section>
    <p>
     This blog post will be an analysis of historic data visualization using the reading by Kidd based on representation. There is a milestone for the history of data visualization. It was created in the sixteenth century, back when the original data visualization was seen through techniques and instruments that were used for precise measurements and techniques and also observations. These measurements are also used for physical quantities, celestial, astronomical and geographic positions in the world. These measurements are also used for methods to map locations. People use to capture images using cameras and record mathematical functions on tables. The creation of the atlas and all these things mention before are the early steps to the beginning of the data visualization. Scheiner’s 1626 representation of the changes of the sunspots over time and Micheal’s 1644 graphic is to be believed to be the first recorded visual representation of statistical data. In the 1700s new graphic forms were created with the help of statistical theories, data of importance and interest, and also the idea of graphic representation. These are new graphs and new domains. Isolines and contours which were invented and considered new data representations. There are abstract graphs and graphs of functions which became more widespread. Economic and political data has begun to collect some visual forms and invent data that could be seen. There was a time in history was data recording was very rare. For about thirty years. I believe that is because there were different methods created that did not need data to recorded at that previous moment in time. Graphs started becoming popular again in the 19th century with the growth of thematic mapping and statistical graphs. These graphic forms were created histograms, pies, and charts. Time series plots, contours plots and scatter plots. Data is used for a variety of topics such economic, political, morals, medical and physical information. Here are examples I can give from these topics for economical purposes. An example of economics can be used in a countries unemployment rate. The political purpose of a graph can be used for the polls to see the graphs and pies of the political parties during voting time. It shows which political parties has the biggest votes and the lowest votes. Moral graphs can be used for a variety of comparison of which gender is most likely to certain things such as which gender smokes the most or which gender is most likely to do certain things. These graphs and pies are used to compare and see which gender is most likely to do something depending on the topic. Medical example of graphs can be used for the covid increase from a certain amount of days and it shows the increase and decrease from different provinces. This was shown in the news last year when they did covid statics. (Friendly, 2008). A certain magazine shows that pictures that display information. The idea of data visualizing is old. There is also the idea of infographics. This website uses examples just Friendly readings on different data visuals that were created. It talks about the pie graphs that have been drawn. There are also data visualizations on one of sad events of humanity which is slavery. These data visualizations are called “slave maps”. These were used to see the population of these countries. (Thompson, n.d.)

    <h1>Week5: Knaflic's Disecting Modle Visuals</h1>
    <p>
    <section>
    This reading focuses on the chapter six section of the Knaflic storytelling of data. The reading starts with an introduction then uses a line graph as model visual number one. The reading goes into detail about the line graph for example, it goes in detail about the graph title, vertical axis title, and the horizontal axis title These are visually present in the line graph. The lines are visually labelled and there is a good use of text. There is a goal of 50,000 dollars that is drawn in the graph that is referenced. Looking at the axis labels of the line graph, the vertical y-axis can help you consider the rounding of the numbers to thousands. On the horizontal x-axis, there is no need to label every single day because the viewers are more interested in the overall trend. Instead of every single day, the graph focuses on the data between the 10th day to the 30th day of each month. The second visual model graph is an annotated line graph with forecast. These forecasts are annual costs. There are lines that are different and drawn between the forecast data and the actual data. This makes it easier to interpret different types of information. The forecast has solid data that clears the labelling of the forecast and actual data. The reading then goes on about the visual images and lining of the graph. So far, the reading is collecting data about currency and the increase of currency within specific dates. The next model is a graph bar so far, I have seen different type of graphs suited for different things. This model is suitable for data visualization. This graph has the graph title, the legend, the vertical y-axis title, and the upper left position. It shows how the audience reads the graph before you get to the data. The right side there is a text at the top of the aligned final bar of data. These are 100% stacked bar graphs. The fourth model of the leveraging positive and negative bars. These bar graphs show today’s directors and the promotions that these directors get and the number of directors that are in these bar graph. Direction from the acquisitions. This graph shows the date. There are different colours for these different stats on this graph. The directors of today have a different colours. The bar graph has an empty label. There is a lot of detail and information about this graph. Model five, horizontal bar graph talks about the social economy of society. Education, agriculture, rural development, poverty reduction, reconstruction, economic growth, health, job creation, governance, transportation, law, justice, energy, anti-corruption, and basic infrastructure. There is a deal of information in this bar graph. In conclusion, these graphs in these readings carry different information and hold different visual information that provides information on the economy, the social economy including the employment rate of directors, their financial income, and their acquisitions. The graphs are all visually different but provide valid information on the currency and a certain amount and income during each month. (Knaflic, 2020)

    <h1>Week6: Case Study On An Example From The Information Is Beautiful Website</h1>
    <p>
    <section>
        My analysis on the Information is beautiful website. Where does all the world’s food go? How much do we make?
        There are different types of food such as red meat, poultry fish, eggs, milk, dairy, pulses, legumes, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, starchy vegetables, potatoes, cassava yams and squashes. The whole grains are rice, corn, oats, rye, and barley. All these different types of foods are transported to different types of the world. These places include Latin America, North America, North Africa, and middle eastern Africa. Europe, central Asia, East Asia, Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. There are different representations of charts for this food chain and how it shown to sent around worldwide. The second chart is visual than verbal as it shows who gets the food and how many kilograms of people per year. For example, in Latin America there are about 900kg people that get food per year. North America has about 1203kg of people per year that get food. North Africa has about 823kg people to give food to. Europe and Central Asia has 1118kg of people to feed. East Asia and Oceania has about 1083kg of people that need food. Sub-Saharan Africa has 783kg of people that need food. South Asia has a population of 656kg of people that need to be feed. The third graph shows what is being over and under consumed. The graph has images of different foods such as fruits, vegetables, beans, milk, fish, grain, and red meat. The next images has different countries and it shows data of which country on the chart under consumes and over consumes different products. The highest over consumed food is starchy vegetables in Africa. The lowest food product is fruits and vegetables. Looking at the colours in this data in the graph, black means over consumed food products from different countries. Meanwhile white represents the under consumed food products in the chart. In the middle of these colours are medium grey and light grey which show the average consumption of each product in all these different countries. The final graph in this webpage is titled “How Much Do We Really Need?” this shows humanity’s consumption requirement and calorie intake. It shows the ideal production and today’s production. The food product with the most needed idea production is fruits and vegetables. The least needed ideal production is red meat. Looking at today’s production the most needed food products are fruits and vegetables with an approximate of 2013 consumers. The least needed food product from today’s production is red meat with about 212 consumers. This graph uses different colours to make different food products stand out from the graph and these colours seem appropriate. For example, red meat is the colour red. Milk and diary is the colour grey in the graph and fruits and vegetables are the colour green. These colour seem appropriate visually when you associate these colours with these food products. The graph also mentions that the human consumption intake also includes thirty percent of it being human waste. (Hicks, 2021)

    <h1>Week7: The Two Graphs On Data Visualization and Reflection and Communication Strategies Used</h1>
    <p>
        This blog post will be focusing on the graphs displayed on my website. I used the D3 to code a bar graph because I feel like it is the most popular use of graphs that people use for data visualization and graphs through history. The graph used and the arrays for the percentage of numbers. I used these numbers when asking people how much did the coronavirus impact them socially and economically. The highest percentage are of the people that say the coronavirus has affect them socially because they spend more time on social media more than they do on going out. Since we live in South Africa and are on different levels, these levels have had an impact many people’s social lives in terms of restaurants and social gathering being limited. The ban of alcohol depending on which levels were the country on. Economically I can make example of how the coronavirus having an effect on the jobs of fellow South Africans. Many people were jobless and this effect their income therefore effecting the breadwinners at home. According to Li’s reading on Representation, data is collected to identify patterns and give the audience new insights which exactly was what the goal of my graph was. I feel as if a bar graph is easier for visual representation of the people that use technology more since the coronavirus hit the country. It represents data as quickly as possible. (Li, 2020). My bar graph has a bit of a glitch where the given labels are at the top instead of the bottom. But visually the labels are titled Alcohol, Depression, Anxiety, social media, and the Employment Rate in South Africa during the year 2020. The bar graphs are purple because of the style guide inspiration on my design section. I used a variety of symbols such as numbers and names and percentages and a headline. (Li, 2020). I cant explain a second graph because my second br graph was not showing so I had to leave it out.

    <h1>Week8: What Is Interaction for Data Visualization?</h1>
    <p>
    According to this reading interaction for visualization starts with methodology rationale. Methodology shows a lot of papers with the mention of interaction. There are three main reviews. Review 1, the view of interaction based on the community which cannot be captured by the citation numbers instead it needs expert input. I believe this means that community research can be cited but it needs to be reviewed by experts so they can see if they agree with the following research or not. Review 2, this focuses on the lone approach that starts with a set of papers with references. Review 3, this must have papers that include visualization and nothing else. (Dimara & Perin, 2019). The next chapter focuses on the review questionnaire. The questionnaire is about the researchers who have online forms asking for definition papers, these papers help with defining interaction in visualization. The relevant papers are for the topic of interaction. The third topic in this section of the reading speaks about the researchers’ years of experience in visualization. It also talks about the researcher’s interaction experience on a 7 scale point the papers focus on the interaction and there are three optional fields such as name, emails, and comments. (Dimara & Perin, 2019) I believe this method on reviewing questionnaires helps with researching visualization and interaction depending on what you are researching and looking for and the wants and needs of the target market. The method of collecting papers. This part of the reading explains this method through five steps. The first step is starting with the five definition papers. Step two, the questionnaires are then sent to visualization researchers who then suggest linked and definition papers. Step 3 talks about a list of papers these papers are the five definitions of papers. There is also a journal article or a conference paper. Step 4 talks about repeating step 2. The questionnaire is sent to authors of the seeded papers. It then repeats step 3 with new suggestions. (Dimara & Perin, 2019). The method for tagging papers with interaction themes is when two authors develop tags and characterize them with the linked and seed papers. This helps identify the theme of the papers. There are six tags in this section of the reading. The first tag, definition of interaction which is an attempt to define, explain and describe the interaction. The second tag is called the critical on interaction which focuses on the frustrations and complaints about the interaction. This helps with improvements and challenges. The third tag is about the benefits of interactions. This focuses on the positive benefits of interaction. The fourth tag is the interaction concepts. This is the archetypal description of interaction. It gives papers one concept, one model, one design space, one framework and one paradigm. The fifth tag is the interactive pipeline. This is about the discussion of the interaction which relates to the visualization pipeline. The sixth tag is the list. This contributes to the list that contain tasks, techniques, and formal type of lists.

    <h1>Week9: Information Is Beautiful Case Study</h1>
    <p>
     This case study will be focusing on interactivity as a semiotic device using a case study as an example to explain. Looking at this case study as an example in terms of the role of Interactivity as semiotic device. The case study I have chosen is called the Coronavirus Riskiest Activities. This case study focuses on the lowest risk of coronavirus within these types of activities. The second graph is the medium risk of coronavirus within the shown activities. The third graph is the highest risk of coronavirus if you engage with these specific activities. These different graphs were created by more than 500 epidemiologists and health professionals. These graphs contain the risk factors, how many people are involved, the time calculate to the exposure. It includes the location whether the location was indoors or outdoors it has been specified.  It talks about surfaces which talks about high touch. It talks about the areas that have been affected by the coronavirus and the high number of cases. The last stat talks about the covidiocy, which is about the compliance. The term interaction links up to this case study as it is found in semiotic device such as computers and mobile devices so anything that can give you access to the internet. The interaction with the visualization includes physical objects such as the computer, the mouse and eye movement which is needed to move around and view the case study of choice in the visualization. It also includes data representation and the manipulation of visual data. The stats of the case study on the coronavirus activities can be changed if it updated daily, weekly, or monthly to update the audience on the new stats. Interaction has semantics. The interaction has multiple levels of granularity and levels that focus on activities, tasks, and subtasks. (Dimara & Perin, 2020). The graph in the example shows low risks for example it shows you have a low risk of getting the coronavirus by being on a beach. A gas station, grocery shopping, takeout food, seeing a doctor and visiting a vacation home with your family. These events can involve other people, or you can attend these events by yourself. The medium risk includes staying in a hotel, going to the salon, or getting a haircut and exercising in a gym and hosting a barbeque. These type of events does include human contact. The hotel has a lot of staff that you are in contact with. The salon has a lot of customers and staff that in contact with the customer’s hair. A barbeque gives you the option to decide who you can invite and if they have been vaccinated. Other events include eating in a restaurant and cinema even though most of these events include minimum physical contact. The high risk graph shows different events that most likely put you to risk of getting the coronavirus. For example, church which has a lot of people attending in the same venue. If you are a Roman Catholic like myself the church has a procedure of drinking communion wine and bread representing the Lord Jesus Christ but because corona these types of traditions have been minimized. Attending weddings, the guest lists have been limited. Hugs and handshakes are physical contact which can let you catch the virus. Amusement parks have a lot of people as well.

    <h1>Week11: How Art Can Contribute To Ethical Reflection On Risky Technologies</h1>
    <p>
    This reading discusses the techno art in risky technologies. This is discussed as a new technology that has been debated throughout society. Nowadays artists are becoming more interested in technologies. Artists are becoming interested in different ways to evolve their talents in this digital world. This is what we call techno art. This type of art reflects on and engages on risky technologies. The most famous figure spoken about in the reading is famous artist Leonardo Davinci. He is used as an example of a historical figure who engaged with technological and scientific developments. (Roeser, 2016) A specific type of art style such as Romanticism is also an example used as a part of this reading to explain the concept of techno art.it is a part of the pre-industrialized world. There is a number of artists and writers that are engaging in the new technologies created. For example, as a digital artist you are able to create new artists through digital technologies using different artistic applications. You have different artistic tools in these applications which allow you to create art. The genre can be different things for example discussing environmental issues. These technologies allow you to have access to different genre and topics that give visual artists different possibilities. It also gives access to work different types of art such as bio-art, robotic-art, and ICT-art. The next section of the reading discusses the techno-art and the emotional-moral reflection about risk. The examples from the previous section are mentioned in this section before getting into detail on the techno artwork that can reach out to people by drawing into their emotional and imaginative capacities. Techno art includes vivid pictures and images, concrete is provided as well as narratives that make technological developments. I believe this is an example of narrating stories in audio books for writers and their audiences that are too lazy to read, and audio books is more advanced than the original physical books. This helps get a bigger audience. Techno-artists can create awareness of social issues, political issues and economical issues depending on the target audience and the type of messages techno artists are trying to display. Techno artists can also depend on and provide a critical reflection scientific and technological developments. They can give reviews on the technological applications and give feedback on the flaws. Pros and cons as well as advise what can make these applications better and more natural for different artists. For example, an artistic application that techno artists can use is Adobe Draw where it gives the technological version of a canvas and artistic tools and different colours to use when creating the artworks. Techno art helps with displaying political ad ethical thinking of others. The philosophical version approaches the more traditional works of art and engages social relationships. Academic literature on techno art in the artworks give out a rise of emotional responses. Emotional responses trigger the critical reflection. All types of artworks are supposed to give out an emotional or critical responses from different audiences depending on their type of emotions and what type of person they are and as well as their own knowledge and emotional experiences to the artwork and how the artwork relates to their views. (Roeser, 2016). Different works of techno art can provide the audience with different experiences with technologies and emotional moral reflection. These artworks have a different approach and a powerful role in the public eye. The area where the work is displayed also play an important role. The reflections on robotics and ICT and AI such as computers and smartphones. The areas where these artworks can be displayed is computers digital smartphones and websites where they can all be displayed like an art museum for people to view and see. (Roeser, 2016)

    <h1>Week12: Analysis on Data-Driven Art</h1>
    <p>
    The data driven artwork that I used was the artwork by David McCandless. It can be found in the Information is Beautiful website. David McCandless is a designer and writer, who designs data visualization and adds different works of art. This artwork is called Millions of Children’s Lives Have Been Saved. This artwork looks like a beautiful wave with different colours such as green, blue, light green, orange and brown. These lives have been saved due to better healthcare, education, and social conditions. The data driven art also includes the countries in which these children live in. For example, East Asia, the lands in the Pacific, Europe, Central Asia, Latin America, Caribbean, the Middle East, the Northern parts of Africa, South Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. It also has the data information of 750 children per day. 270,000 children were saved per year. 6.8 million children were saved in the last 25 years. What I love about this artwork is that the wave represents the number of children that were saved. This artwork represents the healthcare improvements for children around the years. I believe the different colours and the location of the children in different parts of the world represent the different races of each of these children. Each of the colour of the wave are the same colour of the countries on the side of the artworks. For example, the blue part of the wave represents the children in South Asia. The yellow part of the wave represents the children in the European and central parts of Asia. The orange part of the wave represents the children in East Asia and the lands in the Pacific. The dark green parts of the wave represent the children in the Caribbean and Latin America. The light green part of the wave represents the children living in the Middle east and the northern parts of Africa. The brown part of the wave represents the children living in the Sub-Saharan Africa. The artwork also goes into detail on the major reasons why these children’s lives have been saved. The first reason is the increasing in health spending. The second reason is the higher quality in healthcare. The third reason is the improvement of health knowledge in the medical sections of these parts of the world. The fourth reason is the increasing improvement of education. The fifth reason is the better education given to women in the medical department which increased more female employees in the medical department and the increase of female doctors and nurses. The sixth reason is the rising of prosperity. The seventh reason is the declining of poverty because most of these countries are known as second or third world countries and need improvement in their healthcare so the need of medical care in these countries is needed. Countries such as the poor parts of Asia, Latin America and different countries in Africa needs the improvement in the healthcare department in order to take care of the next generation of humanity.

    <h1>Week13:Reflection on Communication Strategies Used in Data-Driven Art</h1>
    <p>
    This blog post will be discussing the communication strategies used in the data driven art. Using the reading about data-driven communication. This communication is about the audience knowledge characteristics which are important when communicating the data which can be told through the visual images, texts, and data visualizations. Using this information of communication strategies on the data-driven artwork chosen from the previous post. The message that was communicated was the millions of children that were saved because of the improved medical care throughout the years and the artist’s use of small children in the art of the colorful wave. This shows that the target audience is for parents and those who are taking care of children. This data driven artwork attracts those who want the best medical care for their children. Data-driven artworks help relate to the audience through their different backgrounds and their past experiences. For example, the audiences can have past experience of not having good healthcare and want the best for their children, so they are happy about this artwork and data about the improvement of healthcare. The content creators have produced content that their audience can relate too. The data also grows throughout time maybe each day, each month, or each year. The growth of the data helps understand the data and graphs. A content producer has knowledge on the target audience and uses different levels of expertise or knowledge depending on the given topic. The reading uses a different example different from data visualization instead it uses local newspapers and small local publication which most likely have the knowledge within the local area of its establishment. But the same strategies cannot be used for international publication. This communication strategy looking into the data driven artwork it is an international publication as it has been published on the internet and many people have access to the following website where you can find it if you google search Data Driven Art. The internet is an international publication so this artwork can be viewed by people in different parts of the world. Data storytelling takes accountability for baseline information and knowledge that they feed the audience. There is different level of expertise that encourages content producers to think carefully and critically on how they want their product to be seen by the audience. The product needs to meet the needs of the audience. For example, the data driven art that I have chosen was aimed for children with help but because children are unaware of healthcare at a young age the artwork aims at their parents and legal guardians in need of assistance to take care of their children. The designers must consider different factors when deciding the design of the artwork and what message they are trying to send to the audience. The artwork used was easily label and designed to advertise medical care for children from the labelling to the drawing of small children in the wave. Universal designs aim to aspire the data stories created. Different stories have different versions that produce different audiences and attract different audiences. These stories also target unique and different information and knowledge. The data driven artwork aims to grab the attention of different people in the audience bring their own points of view and viewpoints. The artwork focuses on the background, education, social positions, and other demographic characteristics. (Richie, 2018)

    <h1>Week14: Bonus Blog Post On Data-Driven Storytelling Based On An Essay By Richie</h1>
    <p>
     This reading focuses on the reflection of data driven storytelling. It begins with the three principles of data driven storytelling. The first principle discusses the relevant of data stories and that there are different data stories that have a possibility of being misleading, misinformed, and obfuscate. Data stories can also deceive viewers through data visualization. I believe they are referring to data visualization that has not been update in a certain amount of time and therefore can not be reliable to the audience who are looking for the current update on the data visualization. For example, if someone is looking at a data visualization about covid-19 they need an updated visualization if they view the statistics everyday or every month. The reading also discusses the opportunities of misguiding the end users’ interpretation of data and every phase production. The data has been quantified then normalized, annotated and the data has to be made interactive. The second principle discusses the relevance of ways in which insights from data can be found and interpreted into stories. There are many interpretations from the data set. The data set is important to the storyteller so that the storyteller can trace their rationale. It is important because data transformation and acquisition step can be unseen but can be given explicit consideration for disclosure. The third principle discusses another dimension that contains an importance when storytelling with data. It tells of individuals or people who the data represents and how they are treated with respect and humanity they deserve, and they not just used or seen as means to a telling a story. I believe this means that they are more than characters in a story it means their feelings are respected. It follows the terms of following the supporting the goals of the community engagement. The third principle connects to the interactivity of the data storytelling. The designers in the storytelling team engage with the community and the interactivity with the data rather than dictating data which is immutable. Data driven storytelling can have a positive outcome for end users. Data storytelling also contains an algothrims which normalizes the new sets of data. (Richie, 2018) The algothrims contains data such as people’s gender and age based on their posts and connections. The routine depends on the analysis routine and determine the online reviews. Online reviews are used on social media platforms such as websites like Instagram and social media platforms like Instagram have an algothrims for its users and has online reviews for users to give their opinions on what they want to see on their feed.  These online reviews are used to understand users and give them the satisfaction when using these platforms.  Online reviews can also be used for products and the customers satisfaction with the product or give an honest opinion on their personal experience with the product whether positive or negative, feedback from customer is needed to make more improvement. (Richie, 2018). To make a data driven story successful, the storytelling has to be focusing its attention on relevant cases and removing any kinds of distractions. (Richie, 2018). Data driven storytelling has personal information such as names and addresses that is present in the sets of data in the story. Personal information can include political views, criminal records, and arrest as well as the behavior of people. (Richie, 2018). The reading gives examples of graphs used as sets of data and data visualization. The reading also discusses interactive visualizations that provide the capabilities for end user to explore data and have the story presented. The designers of data visualization develop a dialogue with users. The users can navigate, filter the data and search for the data according to their own interests. (Richie, 2018)

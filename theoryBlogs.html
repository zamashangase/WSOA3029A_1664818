    <h1>Week1:Overview of Data Visualization and Reflection </h1>
    <article>
    <p>
This blog post will be focused on the reading on the Overview of Data Visualization and reflects on this 
reading. The reading will be focused on the relationship between the data visualization and aesthetics. 
The first following chapter focuses on the concept of data visualization. The term “data visualization” 
has been known in human history for centuries. Data visualization contributes to the discovery and 
inventions created by mankind throughout human history. The chapter also uses the invention of 
computers as an example of the change of the way visual representation of data. The data analyst is 
the highest and successful accuracy in terms of using the computer graphical data visualization. It is 
an important part of research in fields such as animation, computer vision, algothrims and human 
perception. But data visualization is mainly associated with the field, computer science. This chapter 
has so far discussed the technology of data visualization which has evolved from early sketches and 
drawings. Data visualization focuses on the understanding of the data instead of having other 
approaches that are considered as traditional data visualization. (Li, 2020)There are different 
advantages of traditional data visualization. Firstly, it has the ability to represent a lot of data as quickly 
as possible. Secondly, it enables viewers to identify patterns in the data for new insights. Thirdly, it 
can be used product quality control where they can identify problems through the data analysis. The 
next chapter focuses on the definition of the data visualization. There are various meanings and 
definitions to the data visualization. Many of these definitions focuses on the connection between the 
data and the computer technology so the data can transform into a visual sonic form. Data 
visualization, involve an exchange of information that includes the messenger, the receiver, and the 
message. The purpose of the data visualization is to help and find patterns inside graphs and the 
exploration of data. (Li, 2020). The next chapter focuses on the definition of data and information. The 
chapter goes into detail about the data and how raw it is. It is unprocessed information that has not 
been recognized and it has various meanings. These variety of meanings include the numbers, the 
names, symbols, characters, signs, and symbols. The other meanings are also the graphs which were 
discussed in class. The other meanings are files and reports that are used for business context. Data is 
a part of giving information to society. Data includes collecting information from humans through the 
internet and smartphones and of course surveys. There are two different types of data including 
secondary and primary data. The secondary data focuses on the collection of data through the use of 
file reports, research reports, file censuses and surveys meanwhile primary data focuses on data that 
has been collected from numbers of people and interviews or studies made by taxpayers. (Li, 2020). 
Data visualization refers to the charts, tables, graphs, diagrams, and scatter plots. It is the visual form 
of these charts and other collection forms of data that represent the traditional version of data 
visualization. (Li, 2020)

<h1>Week2: Blog Post About Website I often Use </h1>
	<article>
    <p>
The website I have chosen for this blog post is the Instagram website because Instagram is one of the 
websites I often use.
The design of the homepage, since Instagram is a photo sharing app so the main thing in the middle 
of the homepage is the image that has been shared by people you are following. The top corner of the 
homepage has the name of Instagram. The top right corner has an icon for people to send direct 
messages to whoever they are following. It also shows the number of messages you have not read. 
Below the shared images on the homepage, it shows the amount likes that each image has. There are 
three icons below the images that have been shared. The first icon is the heart icon you press when 
you like an image. The second icon is the comment icon used to comment on photos that have been 
shared. The third icon is used to share the image to people you follow in direct messages or on your 
story. There is an icon at the bottom of the image at the right corner that is used to save the image in 
a saved personal gallery on Instagram. The user can even caption the image to make it more 
interesting. There is an icon with profile picture that is used to share stories or give your opinion on 
different matters. There are icons on the bottom of the home page that when you click it you are 
directed to the explore page, the page that shows you who and how many people have liked your 
photos. An icon for your profile that takes you to your profile. Finally, there is an icon used for posting 
your images that you want to share.
The UI of the homepage, Instagram has a design process that is used on the user interface has 
systematic and information-oriented visual design. Instagram has an icon for businesses to sell and for 
consumers to sell their products. Instagram uses this icon to find international consumers because it 
is a worldwide website that is very popular especially to the youth. It has a feature for business 
markets and business owners to promote their products by paying for ads everywhere for potential 
customers to see and view the business profiles. (Marcus, 1998)
The UX of the homepage, the UX research looking at last semester’s readings including the needs and 
wants of human beings. The UX in the homepage in terms of needs on the website has links that lead 
the user to their personal profile, another need is for example if the user needs to see what their 
favorite person is doing or has posted on the profile and story on Instagram. The users want can be 
the on the explore page link on the homepage for users to search the profile they want to see or 
explore pages that might interest the user. Instagram has an algothrims and tends to show the users 
what they want or search or google and that aesthetic and content will show on the explore page for 
example, Instagram will show the profiles on the users’ favorite artists, hobbies, musicians, food 
recipes and anime fan pages. (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2011). Instagram is an example of a software 
that researches the emotions and interests of humans. Also, Instagram has a way of recommending 
you to other pages that you might find interesting. (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2011). Different users 
have different emotions depending on the data research.
According to Kidd the use of signs such as words, images and sounds is used for the representation 
that can be used for websites in order for the user to be familiar with the setup of the website and 
where to go. The signs are used for a medium of communication. There is no connection between the 
words, sounds and the things look on the website homepage and how things can be described. The 
representation of websites according to Kidd has semiotics including the coming together of the 
signifier and the signified that gives the user the sign. From my understanding from FVPA in first year 
the semiotics od the signifier and signified are the representation of an image or object and what is 
the meaning of it. As well as the emotions and theme surrounding it. (Kidd, 2020).
